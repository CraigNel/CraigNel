- 👋 Hi, I’m @CraigNel
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Technical Copywriter...what is that? It's the bridge between copywriting (content to attract attention like ads, promotions, social media posts etc.) and technical writing (content to explain or guide someone how to do or use something like manuals, instructions and FAQ's). 

  Today 80% of the sales cycle in the B2B software market is done by the customer first researching and learning about products or services through brochures, white papers, case studies, website content and more before reaching out. If companies can explain their complex software in plain language through this content then most of the work is already done...that's technical copywriting!
  
  It requires a unique skill, namely translating technical jargon from programmers and developers into easy-to-understand 'why is this valuable?' or 'how will this solve my challenege?' content that regular people can understand.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use platforms like GitHub which is the standard in sharing writing content
- 💞️ I’m looking to offer my services in any capacity to learn about the market. Currently I'm in business development for an ISP ('independent software vendor' in case you didn't know) so I'm familiar with the B2B enterprise world and already create this type of content and planning to go full time in the near future
- 📫 While I'm setting up my own company and domain please use my non-proffesional craigabroad@gmail.com
